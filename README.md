create2remix
============

This is another iRobot Create 2 library based in Python. The main one that
everyone else uses
[here](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/pycreate2). The difference is
as follows:

- pycreate2 does not have the capabilities to stream sensor data, whereas this
  library can.
- pycreate2 no longer supports Python 2, where as this library does (for ROS
  noetic and below).

This library is also inspired and partially translated from https://github.com/AutonomyLab/libcreate. 

Instructions
------------

TODO... The code is actually relatively straightforward. The API is similar to
pycreate2, so reading the code itself might help.
